# Instructions for use:

This extension is not yet compiled so you can just add the files to chrome manually.

1. Open your extensions in your browser: chrome://extensions/
2. Turn on developer mode
3. Click "Load Packed"
4. Point the browser at your folder containing these files

It should load the extension.

You can click on your extensions icon and pin the extension if you want it to always be visible. The extension identifies if you are on a page of a karabast.net game, and if so it will scrape and download the chat log of the game.

Pretty simple
